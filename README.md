Reflection

My main problem when creating my dashboard I wanted a layout reasonably large enough to work with, and one that will fit the display that I would be showing it on. I rectified this by manually typing in the resolution for the dashboard to be displayed on a typical desktop computer screen of 1920x1080, which I believe would be the best size for most cases.

Working out how to apply floating to the entire dashboard was incredibly helpful, instead of doing it for each individual object I could apply to it everything so I could easily move objects around.

There does not seem to be a very strong direct correlation between GDP, Smartphones and life expectancy, so I did not want to create a visualisation relating the two, keeping them separate.

Each country only has data collected for it from a specific year, so filtering any of these out would completely remove the country from the dataset. The gap in years may have changed the values drastically making them poor comparisons, but having to completely remove countries altogether does not seem like an acceptable outcome, as it will not help us draw any conclusions related to ‘Top 20’ countries when we start removing them. Because of this, I have not included any filtering of year the data was acquired even though part of the project was to filter for a specific year.
